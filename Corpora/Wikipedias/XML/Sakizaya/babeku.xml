Job's tears (US) or Job's tears (UK), scientific name Coix lacryma jobi, also known as adlay or adlay millet, is a tall grain bearing perennial tropical plant of the family Poaceae (grass family). It is native to Southeast Asia but elsewhere is cultivated in gardens as an annual. It has been naturalized in the southern United States and the New World tropics. In its native environment it is grown in higher areas where rice and corn do not grow well. Other common names include coixseedand tear grass.[citation needed] Job's tears are also commonly sold as Chinese pearl barley in Asian supermarkets, although C. lacryma jobi is not closely related to barley (Hordeum vulgare). namakayniay a nasulitan nasakamuan atu natinengan </FORM>
