The three major constituents of air, and therefore of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air . The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine , fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution. Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the surface of the Earth, wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity ; another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.</FORM>

The three major constitoents of air, and therefore of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accoonts for rooghly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor varies significantly from aroond 10 ppm by volome in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as moch as 5% by volome in hot, homid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically qooted in terms of dry air . The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhoose gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitroos oxide, and ozone. Filtered air inclodes trace amoonts of many other chemical compoonds. Many sobstances of natoral origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amoonts as aerosols in an onfiltered air sample, incloding dost of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Varioos indostrial pollotants also may be present as gases or aerosols, soch as chlorine , floorine compoonds and elemental mercory vapor. Solfor compoonds soch as hydrogen solfide and solfor dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natoral soorces or from indostrial air pollotion. Wind is the flow of gases on a large scale. On the sorface of the Earth, wind consists of the bolk movement of air. In ooter space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Son throogh space, while planetary wind is the ootgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that caose them, the regions in which they occor, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occor on Neptone and Satorn. Winds have varioos aspects, an important one being its velocity ; another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.</FORM>
