In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity.Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter W, is the product of the mass m of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration g; thus: W mg. The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is distant (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa). namakayniay a nasulitan nasakamuan atu natinengan How to find product to sell or promote online </FORM>
