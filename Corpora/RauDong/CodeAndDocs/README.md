# Formosan-RauDong

This repository contains the 20 glossed texts from 

Rau, D. V., and Dong, M. N. (2006). Yami texts with reference grammar and dictionary. Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.

The nature of how the machine-readable version was obtained is such that we do not have a reproducible pipeline.
